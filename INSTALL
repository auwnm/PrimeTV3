The program has only been tested in UBUNTU and MAC.

It's compiled using CMAKE.

For example (to build) :

git clone https://github.com/jfnavarro/PrimeTV2.github

mkdir primetv_build

cd primetv_build

cmake ../PrimeTV3

make && make install

(you can run tests by typing "make test")

The list of packages needed to compile PrimeTV2 are :

	BISON
	FLEX
	QT5
	Cairo >= 1.0
	BOOST >=1.42

To install the dependencies :

- They can be installed in Ubuntu by using the following commands :

sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libboost-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-program-options-dev libcairo2-dev bison flex

- They can be installed in Fedora by using the following commands :

sudo yum install cairo-devel boost-devel cmake-devel

- They can be installed in MAC by using the following commands :

sudo port install cmake
sudo port install cairo
sudo port install boost
sudo port install bison
sudo port install flex

As well as the C++ compiler and developer essentials.

You can install qt5 from binaries :

http://qt-project.org/downloads

NOTE : Remember to tell cmake where qt5 cmake libraries are installed using -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH

The exec file "primetv" will be placed in usr/bin (Ubuntu) or Applications/primetv.app (Mac) or an alternative location indicated in CMake by -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

NOTE : it is possible to create MAC OSX bundles by typing : make dmg on a mac machine
